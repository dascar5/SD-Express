<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Setting this up for yourself is really easy, as this huge repo includes all the plugins you need.

### Set up

You simply have to download this repo as a .zip, and upload it to your hosting service. Then update wp-config.php with your new server info. I personally use and recommend SiteGround, as they're super cheap and basic to set up.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

This is a general purpose Multi-Vendor E-Commerce platform. You can sell anything you want, disable the Multi-Vendor functionality if you want, and so much more. This repo does not come with products and images, you are going to have to add your own.

I recommend adding this custom CSS, as it fixes the overlap between Account Menu and the helper popup, something theme creators missed. I don't want to mess with the original theme files in this repo, that's why I'm posting it here.

```css
.site-header .dropdown-menu {
  z-index: 9999;
}
```
